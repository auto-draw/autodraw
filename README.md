<h1> Introduction </h1>
AutoDrawer is a program that allows users to draw imported images using their cursor. The program supports Windows and Linux. The program controls the movement of the cursor, allowing for precise tracing of an imported image. AutoDrawer is often used as a utility in drawing games, providing an easy and intuitive way for players to draw images.

AutoDrawer was originally created as a fork of [rainzhao2000](https://github.com/rainzhao2000/autodrawer)'s software and
has since been modified to support automatic drawing in more drawing games. This version is coded in C# and uses the WPF
user interface framework. AutoDrawer is open source and only supports the Windows operating systems.

* Internally we have had success with Linux on X11, however latest builds crash. Do not try to build for Linux, it won't work.
  We intend on moving to our own input service to support both Wayland and X11.
** MacOS is likely in a similar state ^, had previously worked, additionally requires signatures for proper release.
