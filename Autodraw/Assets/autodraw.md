"This project first started by Siydge as a passion project from v3rmillion. It first begun as a fork of an AutoIt script, fixed to work on more Roblox games, before I shortly moved to instead fixing a .NET WinForm app by Rainzhao2000 to work better for Roblox and other games as a whole. During this development, AlexDalas, also known as gz9 joined me with the development, and later on down the line we fully re-wrote all of the code to move from .NET WinForms to Avalonia, to aim to one day support all Desktop Systems." - Siydge
